# Nihiloor
A python discord bot with voice command support
Voice client in the works.
Python 3.10 required.
I remade the entire bot so that its easier to update and fixed most of its issues in the process.
I still need to implement some features from the old bot.

Current Features:  

Basic music player with looping support  
The ability to add songs to queue from either the discord client, or from a websocket server  
>In the future i'll make a voice client that sends the commands to said websocket server.
