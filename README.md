# Nihiloor
A python discord bot with voice command support

You need to run a separate python file that connects to the bot using websockets and sends it the voice commands if you want to use them.

This bot also requiers a database on wich it logs the songs users and servers, used to play a server's or user's most played (favorite) songs

I am currently working on a better, far more optimal version of this code, since its trash in its current state. If you need help running this bot contact me.
